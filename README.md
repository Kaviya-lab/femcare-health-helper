Endometriosis is a chronic and underdiagnosed gynecological condition, with diagnostic delays of up to 7–10 years due to non-specific and normalized symptom presentation. 
The absence of non-invasive early screening tools contributes to delayed clinical intervention. 
This problem proposes an AI-assisted risk screening system that analyzes menstrual health data and symptom patterns to identify individuals at high risk of endometriosis. 
The system functions as a decision-support tool, providing interpretable risk scores to encourage timely specialist consultation and improve early-stage detection.
